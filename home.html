        <h2>What is the Nintendo Switch?</h2>
        <h3>Nintendo Switch is designed to go wherever you do, transforming from home console to portable system in a snap. So you get more time to play the games you love, however you like.</h3>

        <h2>Joy Con</h2>
        <p>
            The Switch’s Joy-Con controllers, on each side of the Joy-Con Grip, are also interesting. It’s got four triggers, as is standard at this point. The two Joy-Con controllers are detachable for remote play, usable either alone or as a pair in each hand. When removed for portable use, those controllers only have one joystick each and no D pad, but both a bumper and a trigger. They’re really tiny. The plus and minus buttons are literally in those shapes, instead of printed on circle buttons, which is a cute detail.

        <h2>Pro Controller</h2>
        <p>
            Pro Controller Like an Xbox controller, the Switch’s pro controller will situate its joysticks on a diagonal rather than a horizontal axis. On the Switch, the second analog stick will be on the bottom right. This frees up the top right side of the controller for button-mashing—buttons that, like the Wii U Pro’s, Xbox’s and PS4's, are in a diamond shape.
